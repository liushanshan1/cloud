In the improved Deep residual shrinkage network based on dense block (DB-DRSN), Dense block constructs the Residual shrinkage block unit based on dense block (DB-RSBU), uses the bottleneck layer to replace the convolutional hidden layer in the residual shrinkage module, and adds the Concat connection. To make full use of shallow and deep features. After each dense connection, the dimension is reduced by 1Ã—1 convolution, and the attention module and soft threshold are used to assign different thresholds to the channel-by-channel features and reduce noise.
